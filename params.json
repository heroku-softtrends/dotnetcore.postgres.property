  "body": "### Welcome to .NET Core on Heroku.\r\nThis project is dedicated to running .NET Core and ASP.NET Core on Heroku using custom buildpacks. To begin, click the following Heroku Button to deploy a very basic ASP.NET Core app, built in Visual Studio, to Heroku. \r\n\r\n[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/herokumx/herokumxnet)\r\n\r\n### What is .NET Core? \r\nA re-imagined version of .NET that is suitable to be deployed alongside web apps and places a strong focus on a new set of assemblies and APIs based on the PCL 2.0 profile. This is a full open source project, with Microsoft taking contributions and developing in the open. This is owned and supported by Microsoft.\r\n\r\n### How is this different from Mono? \r\nThe version published under Mono is a snapshot of the .NET Framework source code. While Microsoft is publishing the source code, they are not actively developing Mono, nor are they taking patches. This is not supported by Microsoft. To read more about the differences, check out http://www.mono-project.com/docs/about-mono/dotnet-integration/\r\n",
